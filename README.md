# ots-fosim
Extension of OTS which can be used as a simulation core within FOSIM. This is part of a project between Delft University of Technology and Enigmatry, funded by Rijkswaterstaat. In this project OTS and FOSIM communicate with eachother using Sim0mq. FOSIM is extended to be able to provide the information that OTS needs, such as specific parameter values. OTS is extended to support certain features that are part of FOSIM, such as batch running for capacity estimation.

For technical issues such as on feature implementation and bugs, see the [Issues](https://github.com/WJSchakel/ots-fosim/issues) section.<br>
For higher level descussions on software design and desired features, see the [Discussions](https://github.com/WJSchakel/ots-fosim/discussions) section.
